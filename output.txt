In his paper "Life at Low Reynolds Number", E.M. Purcell discusses the difficulties of living and moving around in a world where the dominant force is not gravity, but viscous drag. He describes how, in such a world, even the simplest tasks become difficult, and how creatures must adapt their bodies and behaviours in order to survive. Purcell uses the example of a corn syrup-filled vessel to demonstrate some of the principles at work, and ends by saying that this is a story he has been wanting to tell his friend Viki for some time.
