PROMPT:

Can you summarise and explain this to me like I'm 12. Also, write this summary in the format of a book:

Input: Life at Low Reynolds Number E.M. Purcell Lyman Laboratory, Harvard University, Cambridge, Mass 02138 June 1976 American Journal of Physics vol 45, pages 3-11, 1977.  Editor's note: This is a reprint of a (slightly edited) paper of the same title that appeared in the book Physics and Our World: A  Symposium in Honor of Victor F. Weiskopf, published by the American Journal of Physics (1976). The personal tone of the original  talk has been preserved in the paper, which was itself a slightly edited transcript of a tape. The figures reproduce transparencies  used in the talk. The demonstration involved a tall rectangular transparent vessel of corn syrup, projected by an overhead projector  turned on its side. Some essential hand waving could not be reproduced.  This is a talk that I would not, I'm afraid, have the nerve to give under any other circumstances. It's a story I've been saving up to  tell Viki. Like so many of you here, I've enjoyed from time to time the wonderful

RESPONSE:

In his paper "Life at Low Reynolds Number", E.M. Purcell discusses the difficulties of living and moving around in a world where the dominant force is not gravity, but viscous drag. He describes how, in such a world, even the simplest tasks become difficult, and how creatures must adapt their bodies and behaviours in order to survive. Purcell uses the example of a corn syrup-filled vessel to demonstrate some of the principles at work, and ends by saying that this is a story he has been wanting to tell his friend Viki for some time.
